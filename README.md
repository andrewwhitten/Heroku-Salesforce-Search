# Heroku-Salesforce-Search

Salesforce has some good mechanisms for querying data, however limitations of the platform become apparent when you have:

* SOQL Query joins across multiple large objects
* SOQL Query joins across Objects with no direct Lookup relationships
* SOQL wildcard text matching queries over millions of records
* Advanced query functions that have no equivalent in SOQL or SOSLÂ 

I have built a simple proof of concept on the free-tier of Salesforce's Heroku that will give you access to this functionality. For this example I have defined three different methods of querying a Postgres database for Contacts

To build this you will need Heroku and Salesforce (both free signups), and your architecture will look something like this:
