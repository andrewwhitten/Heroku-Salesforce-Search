# Heroku-Salesforce-Search

Salesforce has some good mechanisms for querying data, however limitations of the platform become apparent when you have:

* SOQL Query joins across multiple large objects
* SOQL Query joins across Objects with no direct Lookup relationships
* SOQL wildcard text matching queries over millions of records
* Advanced query functions that have no equivalent in SOQL or SOSLÂ 

I have built a simple proof of concept on the free-tier of Salesforce's Heroku that will give you access to this functionality. For this example I have defined three different methods of querying a Postgres database for Contacts

To build this you will need Heroku and Salesforce (both free signups), and your architecture will look something like this:

In the two projects provided you will find:

* A custom LWC search screen in Salesforce
* A (small) Apex class for invoking the search services
* A custom Heroku web service created in NodeJS
* A Postgres database hosted on Heroku
* A Heroku Connect component to syncronize data between Salesforce and Postgres

# Steps Overview

This Proof of Concept is not intended for Production system, or systems that hold Production data. There is no security setup in this code and configuration.

# Step 1: Create Heroku Connect Service

In Heroku, create a free Postgres Database and Heroku Connect instance:

Setup the Contact object mapping fields between your trial org. For this simple example I have just chosen the following fields:

* CreatedDate
* Id
* IsDeleted
* Name
* SystemModstamp
* FirstName
* LastName
