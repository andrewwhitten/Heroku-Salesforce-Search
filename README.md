# Heroku-Salesforce-Search

Salesforce has some good mechanisms for querying data, however limitations of the platform become apparent when you have:

* SOQL Query joins across multiple large objects
* SOQL Query joins across Objects with no direct Lookup relationships
* SOQL wildcard text matching queries over millions of records
* Advanced query functions that have no equivalent in SOQL or SOSLÂ 

I have built a simple proof of concept on the free-tier of Salesforce's Heroku that will give you access to this functionality. For this example I have defined three different methods of querying a Postgres database for Contacts

To build this you will need Heroku and Salesforce (both free signups), and your architecture will look something like this:

In the two projects provided you will find:

* A custom LWC search screen in Salesforce
* A (small) Apex class for invoking the search services
* A custom Heroku web service created in NodeJS
* A Postgres database hosted on Heroku
* A Heroku Connect component to syncronize data between Salesforce and Postgres

# Steps Overview

This Proof of Concept is not intended for Production system, or systems that hold Production data. There is no security setup in this code and configuration.

# Step 1: Create Heroku Connect Service

In Heroku, create a free Postgres Database and Heroku Connect instance:

Setup the Contact object mapping fields between your trial org. For this simple example I have just chosen the following fields:

* CreatedDate
* Id
* IsDeleted
* Name
* SystemModstamp
* FirstName
* LastName

Note that setting up Heroku Connect will define the Postgres schema for you, with no additional configuration needed.

I havn't covered indexes in this proof of concept since the queries won't benefit from them with the limited number of records possible in a Salesforce Developer sandbox, however you can define you own Views and Indexes afterwards.

# Step 2: Create some Contacts

Load up some Contacts into Salesforce with first names and last names. I downloaded a list of artists from Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/momanyc/museum-collection and uploaded them into Salesforce with the Salesforce Data Import Wizard.

# Step 3: Setup the Heroku App

Setup your App with the instructions defined here: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs?singlepage=true

You can them put in the code defined in the Heroku directory of my respositiory.

Then set up a Config Var called 'ON_HEROKU' and set the value as 1. This is to tell the App that it is deployed to Heroku rather than running locally on the developer machine.

# Step 4: Test the Heroku App

At this point it is worth making sure that the service is running correctly, so you can try out Postman (or similar REST testing tool) against it. Ensure there is no authorization (for this demo) and send a Raw JSON payload in the body against it:

# Step 5: Deploy the Salesforce App

In the Salesforce directory of my respository is a simple LWC Control, Apex Class and Named Credental to deploy against your Salesforce org. Add the Control to any Lightning page, and fix the URL of the named credential to your Heroku service.
